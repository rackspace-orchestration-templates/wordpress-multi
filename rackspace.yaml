  WordPress is a flexible, powerful and open-source content management system
  written in PHP.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to WordPress, the [First Steps With
  WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress)
  documentation will step you through the process of logging into the admin
  panel, customizing your blog, and changing your theme.

  The [WordPress Lessons](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Lessons) cover a
  wide range of topics for users and designers.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  If you provided a domain name that is associated with your Rackspace Cloud
  account and chose to create DNS records, you should be able to navigate to
  the provided domain name in your browser. If DNS has not been configured yet,
  please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  deployment via domain name. Please note: some applications like WordPress,
  Drupal, and Magento may not work properly unless accessed via domain name.

  #### Migrating an Existing Site
  If you'd like to move your existing site to this deployment, there are
  plugins available such as
  [duplicator](http://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) or [WP Migrate
  DB](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/) that can help ease the
  migration process. This will give you a copy of the database that you can
  import into this deployment. There are a number of other tools to help with
  this process. Static content that is stored on the filesystem will need to be
  moved manually.

  #### Plugins
  There are over 23,000 plugins that have been created by an engaged developer
  community. The [plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/)
  provides an easy way to discover popular plugins that other users have found
  to be helpful. [Managing
  Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins) is important and you
  should be aware that some plugins decrease your site's performance so use
  them sparingly.

  #### Scaling out
  There is not yet an automatic way to add additional nodes to this deployment.
  You could manually expand the deployment by taking a snapshot of one of the
  slave web servers and build a new server from the snapshot. Once it is online
  the lsyncd configuration on the master server would need to be altered so
  that file changes are pushed to the new server and the new server would need
  to be added to the Cloud Load Balancer configuration.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  A system user of 'wp_user' or the username you provided as a part of your
  deployment has been created with the same password as your WordPress user.
  This user can be used to SCP, SFTP, or FTP content over to your site. We
  recommend using SCP or any encrypted protocol. Clear text protocols such as
  FTP could inadvertently expose your user credentials.

  WordPress itself was installed using [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/). WordPress
  is installed in /var/www/vhosts/YOUR DOMAIN/ and served by
  [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/). The web site configuration is in
  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. The configuration file will be named using the
  domain name used as a part of this deployment (for example, domain.com.conf).

  In order to significantly improve performance, Apache has been moved to run
  on port 8080, and [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) is listening on
  port 80. Varnish will cache content served by WordPress, store it in memory,
  and then serve it from memory if any subsequent requests are made for the
  same content. A special configuration file build for WordPress is in place.
  The configuration can be found in /etc/varnish/include/.

  [Lsyncd](https://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/) has been in installed to sync
  static content across the front end servers. All new content will be
  published to the master node and then synced across with lsync to the other
  web nodes. When uploading content while migrating a site, you'll only need to
  upload the content to the master node. The configuration for lsync can be
  found in /etc/lsyncd.

  [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html) has been installed to
  allow you FTP access to the content of your site. As mentioned earlier, you
  can use the WordPress username and password provided as the credentials for
  FTP.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is the database backend used in this
  deployment, and it has been deployed on it's own server. The MySQL root
  password is included in the password section of this deployment. If you do
  lose the password, it is also available in /root/.my.cnf on the database
  server. MySQL backups are performed locally by
  [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/). The backups will be stored on the
  database server in /var/lib/mysqlbackup.

  #### Updating WordPress
  If you'd like to update WordPress to the newest version, you can leverage the
  [One-click
  Update](http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress#One-click_Update) now
  available through the web interface. This is the simplest, most pain free way
  to upgrade your installation. Keeping your installation up to date is
  important for maintaining site security.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
